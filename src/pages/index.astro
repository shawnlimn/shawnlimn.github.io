				I am a Research Scientist at MiroMind, working on large language models, long horizon reasoning, and agentic systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the past year, I led the effort on agentic preference optimization for the MiroThinker series. Welcome to try it out <a href="https://dr.miromind.ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="cactus-link">here</a> 🪞✨.

				Previously, I was an NLP Quant Research Scientist at GIC, and co-founded a legal AI startup, where I helped define the core research problems and built systems for contract understanding and reasoning.

			<p>
				I am particularly interested in developing an AI assistant’s sense of taste, how it learns to recognize and internalize what "good" looks like. I don't quite know where to start yet, but I find that part of the problem especially fun.
